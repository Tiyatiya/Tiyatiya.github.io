I happen to have some pretty cool friends; not that I'm bragging or anything. They're just awesome. One couple in particular are having a baby soon and in my enthusiasm I exclaimed, "A bab-by?? I want to make a thing for your bab-by!". And so I did. I ended up making many things for their bab-by. One happened to be a special request for a cross between a crab and a dinosaur... a crabasaurus! Behold this cute monsterous thing!

So, the crabasaurus was pretty fun. But it wasn't very practical, just a cute thing to have in the corner of the nursey or something. A few times later we were all hanging out and somehow the topic of tardigrades came into dicussion. Tardigrades are amazing. They're nearly indestructable, they've been sent into space and the most inhospitable areas on Earth. These little awkward pig-bears suck nutrients from moss and are just amazing extremophiles. Waterbears are just about the best things around. 

Anyway, the same couple asked, "...Could you make a tardigrade stuffed animal?". "Oh boy, <i>can</i> I!... Wait, can I?" So I thought about it:

I began with brainstorming a general pattern on whiteboard. Mind the whiteboard creases, this thing is basically a sticker made of vinyl that I can draw on and I didn't actually want to stick it to the wall. Hence, I posted this vinyl sticker with cheap tape that I could easily remove.

Ordinarily, I would produce a pattern with tracing or contact paper to test my blueprint... buuuuuut I was close to a self-imposed deadline and wanted to jump right into the project so I decided to work and adjust as I went along sewing the pieces together. I don't suggest skipping the 'refining the pattern' step, I just happen to do it this time because I apparently enjoy working the hard way. These are in progress:

And still not completely finished! But I've got a good feeling that this will be 1. A huge soft fleece pillow (this already is a little over three feet long, unstuffed) 2. Something this little baby will probably confuse a lot of her peers with when she eventually starts talking about her having stuffed tardigrade and crabasaurus friends growing up...
