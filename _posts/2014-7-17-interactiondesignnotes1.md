So this isn't a particularly new book. In fact, I believe <i>Make It So</i> was published in 2012 but I just now got around to reading it. Besides the design tutorials I plan to have on this site, I also anticipate posting notes that I come across about design-related topics. Mainly they're for my own use to help me process knowledge but I figure if anyone happened to stumble onto my little nook of the internet world, they might be interested too. The two co-authors of this book are highly seasoned, well respected designers within Silicon Valley. Very smart, observant guys with an obvious passion for design, interaction, and solving problems. So here are a few pointers broken down from the first few chapters.

One really interesting question they pose at the beginning of the book is "Why look to Fiction?" And their response was (taken as an excerpt): <i>interface makers in the real world and in sci-fi are, essentially, doing the same thing – creating new interfaces... When designers create anything that isn't the real, final product that ships, they're creating speculative interfaces – fictions...</i> Which makes perfect sense to me. All the storyboarding, narratives, questioning, painting, and brainstorming that we do as designers is really all just playing. The creative process is that of exploration and visual communication all mixed with the wonderful world of fiction. It's arguably one of the most fun parts of the creative process for me.

Later in the book Shedroff and Noessel delve a bit into the history and evolution of the visual representations of sci-fi. They mentioned references of the industrial age and how people were use to the idea that directly manipulating something caused something else to happen. Such as pushing a lever would cause some kind of mechanical interaction of a machine to make a change somewhere else. It introduces the idea that performing a direct action causes something as a reaction, thus there is little abstraction between cause and effect. As things became more sophisticated, like introducing user interfaces, there's much more of an abstraction of what a button does on a screen. There's still a sense of a tight relationship between "direct manipulation" like dragging a file icon to the trashcan icon but now the user never has to think about all the circuits and internal computer communication that's involved. But before graphic user interfaces were introduced, DOS (Disk Operating System) prompt required people to have to input commands to tell the computer what actions needed to take place. This point is interesting to keep in mind, I think, because there's a fact in here that people assume what's going to happen when they make an action before the action takes place because users have a preconceived notion as to what feels right or makes sense to them based on past experiences. And going further to say that when the resulting action doesn't match with a user's expection it not only causes confusion but frustration or some other negative emotion.

Which actually brings us to the next interesting point that Shedroff and Noessel point out: "Build on what users already know". They mention that new interfaces are most understandable when they're built off of what users/audiences are already used to. You can make interfaces easier by giving familiar cues and elements that are commonly fit together. But there is caution in this, as icons and metaphors can have divergent meanings for people and ultimately end up confusing. But there is a way to work around non universal visual language, and that solution is tightening feedback loops. Feedback loops are <i>"the cycles between input and output while optimizing toward some desired state"</i>. The faster these cycles are, the faster a user can learn and focus on getting the system to do what they want. The tighter the loop the more effective the user's interaction will be and the higher the learnability.

My last note for this section deals mainly with visual/graphic design. The way something <i>looks</i> is the first immediate impression we have on something. We're used to thinking in terms of goal-oriented design, "what do we want users to do here?" kinds of questions, but putting visual elements on the backburner isn't good. Cluttered visual elements confuses the composition and can make the message muddled. The appearance is part of a user's experience. It's fundamental to how people will preceive the quality, complexity, and usability of a product. This is why mastering visual hierarchy is so important. Focus, depth, rhythm, color weight, spacing, typography, and element relationships make all the difference between feeling orderly or a hot mess.  

Okay, stay tuned if you're interested as there are a lot more notes to come as I slash my way consuming this fascinating book. :D
