It's the campfire way to tell stories! The actual definition of round robin is one of collaborative storytelling with multiple authors. This side project, working with a young talented gent named <a href="https://github.com/stevearc">Stevearc</a>, is one that remains dear to me. Such nostalgia! I was one of those middle school kids coveting 'pass along' notebooks with my friends, incorporating people we knew into the storylines and creating ridiculous situations to find ourselves in. Sadly, and unsurprisingly the stories in those notebooks were... not particulary good. But with Round Robin we're hoping for some better creative writing; something more mature and thought-out. Or not! Whatever, that's the beauty of these kinds of platforms. We want an environment where people of all ages and professions would be comfortable wearing a creative writing hat. But most importantly, it's just something that's fun, silly, and thoroughly entertaining.

So the basic idea of this service is... Step 1: Have a fun group of friends. Step 2: Set up a story title and basic story description, and invite friends via gmail or directly input their emails. Step 3: Watch the fun unfold!

And we also have forums in the works! I just finished designing it a few weeks ago and it'll probably be our next big feature to the website.

We'll be launching soon-ish! Probably officially later this month.
