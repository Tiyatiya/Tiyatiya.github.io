If you happen to be around San Francisco up until November 30th, it's worth it to go check out <a href="http://www.calacademy.org/academy/exhibits/skulls/">The Academy of Sciences'</a> new temporary skull exhibit. Evidence of the greatness that awaits you below.

This skeleton was impressively large. I didn't realize that the skeleton of a seahorse can calcify so densely.

Some of the smaller skulls included that of hummingbirds, voles and other tiny rodents. The exhibit kindly presented these skulls with magnifying glasses.

The size of the polar bear skull actually took me by surprise. It could have just been a juvenile but this skull was a bit on the smaller side, smaller than what I expected a polar bear skull to be like. I suppose I expected it to be roughly the size of a cow skull but I could have easily cradled this in my palms.

This was a large case of mutated skulls and skulls left with punctures holes inflicted by hunting arrows and presumably animal combat.

So yeah, go check out the exhibit!
