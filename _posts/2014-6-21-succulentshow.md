One gloriously blue morning my sister messages me with an amazing discovery! <a href="http://www.sfsucculent.org/">San Francisco has its own Cactus Society!</a> and they evidently put on shows and sales to nerd out about plants, cross-breeding, and succulent care. This is it. This is one of the main reasons to move to California. The soil here is so great for succulents these beautiful plants pop up in the wild and propogate like crazy.

The reason I'm so attracted to these plants? I'm a terrible plant carer and these guys put up with my harsh neglect. They'll survive with low watering and poor soil quality, a pretty fantastic deal for someone like me who enjoys seeing progression in projects but evidently posseses a slightly blackish thumb... It's turning a little green? Maybe?

I never caught the name of this plant. The label placed in front of its pot merely stated that it had earned the "People's Choice Award for Favorite Single Plant #156". This specimen grew as a large bulbus bush.

This is called <i>kalanchoe butterfly</i>. This unusual succulent, I heard from a seller, at the show is incredibly easy to propogate. It's as simple as plucking off one of those flowery pods and placing the end into soil. I haven't tried it yet but if it's true I imagine I'll be producing a lot of these beauties.

And these! Really cute idea of using urchin shells with airplants to make a jellyfish. Urchin shells are sold relatively cheap around here, maybe about $3 a shell? Along with an ever-growing, low-maintenance air plant (which can also flower apparently! I certainly didn't know that) you can create these adorable things pretty painlessly.
