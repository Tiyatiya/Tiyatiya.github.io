It's the campfire way to tell stories! The actual definition of round robin is one of collaborative storytelling with multiple authors. This side project, working with a young talented gent named Stevearc, is one that remains dear to me. Such nostalgia! I was one of those kids coveting these 'pass along' notebooks with my friends, incorporating people we knew into the storylines and creating ridiculous situations to find ourselves in. Sadly, and unsurprisingly the stories in those notebooks were... not particulary good. But with Round Robin we're hoping for some better creative writing; something more mature and thought out. Or not! Whatever, that's the beauty of these kinds of platforms. We want to build an environment where people of all ages and professions would be comfortable wearing a creative writing hat. But most importantly, it's just something that's fun, silly, and thoroughly entertaining.

So the basic idea of this service is... Step 1: Have the ambition to write a story with friends. Step 2: Set up a story title and basic descriptions, and invite friends via gmail or directly inputing emails. Step 3: Watch all the fun unfold!

And we also have forums in the works! I just finished designing it a few weeks ago and it'll probably be our next big feature to the website.

We'll be launching soon-ish! Probably officially later this month.
